# Semantic Sustainability Assessment
This repository provides data and code of studies to advance the field of semantic sustainablity assessment, i.e., the assessment of text documents via text mining or natural language processing methods from a sustainability perspective. The used methods are generally not new from a text mining or NLP perspective but represent an application of text mining for specific use cases. Hence, the code does not stand in competition to established software (mainly R packages) for text mining or NLP, but builds on them. Some helper functions and scaling options that emerged during the studies could be considered supplementary to established packages in the sense of extended functionality. Most of these utlity functions have been merged into the [textility](https://github.com/manuelbickel/textility) package.

Currently the repository covers below mentioned studies that are stored in separate subfolders.

## MCAPs_GER
Code and data associated with below open access article. **Please note:** The code for MCAPs is currently being improved. I would kindly ask interested readers to contact me directly for the most recent version. The current github version includes major inefficienies regarding one of the loops and is only kept for the sake of transparent scientific documentation.
