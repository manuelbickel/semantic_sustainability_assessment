# Semantic Sustainability Assessment
This repository provides data and code to advance the field of semantic sustainablity assessment, i.e., the assessment of text documents via text mining or natural language processing methods from a sustainability perspective. The basic methods used are not "new" from a text mining or NLP perspective but represent an application of text mining for a specific use case. Hence, the code does not stand in competition to established R packages or text mining or NLP, but builds on them. Codewise only some helper functions and scaling options could be considered as an addition to established packages.

Currently the repository covers below approaches that are stored in separate subfolders:
- MCAPs_GER

**Please note:** The code is currently being improved and converted to an R package. I would kindly ask interested readers to contact me directly for the most recent version. The github version includes **major inefficienies**, which I am reworking using text2vec package. Current version is only kept for the sake of transparent scientific documentation.
