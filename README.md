# semantic_sustainability_assessment_!not uploaded, yet!

This repository contains the data and basic R code of a study conducted to assess the sustainability content and semantic societal networks in climate action plans of sixteen regional centers in the Federal State of Lower Saxony (Germany).

The background of the repository is, that the goal of the author was primarily to produce results for a scientific article which is currently under submission. The primary goal was not to develop a perfect code. Thus, the code is not optimized and may be advanced in many directions. The documentation and structuration for public use is in process. Please contact me, in case questions should arise before this process is finished.
