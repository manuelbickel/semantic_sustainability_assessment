The methods used in the study are gnerally not new from a text mining or NLP perspective but rather represent an application of text mining for a specific use cases. Hence, the code does not stand in competition to established software for text mining, but builds on it. Some helper functions and scaling options that emerged during the study could be considered supplementary to established packages in the sense of extended functionality.

**Please note:** From a programming perspective, the code for MCAPs is outdated, since it includes major inefficienies regarding one of the loops and is only kept for the sake of transparent scientific documentation. Where reasonable, some of the utlity functions used in the study have been improved and merged into the [textility](https://github.com/manuelbickel/textility) package.
